# waxweaver
this is the source code for waxweaver<br/>
it uses c++ gdextension, so it must be opened in godot 4.2 or it won't work<br/>
just the "theSandbox" folder is required if you would like to open the project<br/>
"src" contains the c++ code which pertains to blocks and world generation and other intensive stuff<br/>
you'll have to figure out how to compile the c++ code yourself if you'd like to play around with that stuff<br/>
